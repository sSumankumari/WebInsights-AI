scikit-learn,"scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See the About us page for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Installation Dependencies scikit-learn requires: Python (>= 3.9)

NumPy (>= 1.19.5)

SciPy (>= 1.6.0)

joblib (>= 1.2.0)

threadpoolctl (>= 3.1.0) Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. scikit-learn 1.0 and later require Python 3.7 or newer. scikit-learn 1.1 and later require Python 3.8 or newer. Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with plot_ and classes end with Display) require Matplotlib (>= 3.3.4). For running the examples Matplotlib >= 3.3.4 is required. A few examples require scikit-image >= 0.17.2, a few examples require pandas >= 1.1.5, some examples require seaborn >= 0.9.0 and plotly >= 5.14.0. User installation If you already have a working installation of NumPy and SciPy, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using pip: pip install -U scikit-learn or conda: conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn The documentation includes more detailed installation instructions.

Development We welcome new contributors of all experience levels. The scikit-learn community goals are to be helpful, welcoming, and effective. The Development Guide has detailed information about contributing code, documentation, tests, and more. Weâ€™ve included some basic information in this README. Source code You can check the latest sources with the command: git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git Contributing To learn more about making a contribution to scikit-learn, please see our Contributing guide. Testing After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the source directory (you will need to have pytest >= 7.1.2 installed): pytest sklearn See the web page https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#testing-and-improving-test-coverage for more information. Random number generation can be controlled during testing by setting the SKLEARN_SEED environment variable. Submitting a Pull Request Before opening a Pull Request, have a look at the full Contributing page to make sure your code complies with our guidelines: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html
